# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

But instead we use Docker.

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up web // starts the server in development
```


### Running tests

```
docker-compose up test
```

This will boot a test environment and run the rspec suite.
